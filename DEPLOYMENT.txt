DEVELOPMENT RECOMMENDATIONS (not required, but helps)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set up virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper so that python libs are easy to version,
and so you don't have conflicts between different python projects:
    http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/

This allows you to do stuff like:
    workon cbu
which will switch to the cbu virtual environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEPLOYMENT PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system-setup and code deployment process uses Fabric, a python-based
deployment tool.

The minimum requirement for the Python scripts is 
    * Python 2.6.x
    * pip-2.6, installed with: easy_install pip

Scripts have their own pre-requisites which are installed using a pip 
requirements file (included in the tools_server/ folder):
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Fabric uses a script and different configuration files. The default script
filename is fabfile.py, and configuration files are called "rcfile". To
facilitate this naming convention, all configuration files are rcfile.ENV,
where ENV is the environment to which to deploy. Eg. rcfile.demo would be
the configuration set for the 'demo' environment.

The fabric script is located in the root of the project as of this writing.
However, this location may change in future, since deployment scripts really
should be versioned separately from the code project.

Configuration files are NEVER versioned with the project since they contain
sensitive information. Configuration files (rcfiles) are versioned in a private
repository. Please consult with a sysadmin for the location of this repo.

SETTING UP FOR DEPLOYMENT:
The deployment host is assumed to have the following:
    * SSH key (or pem file) to connect to the target environment under the
      appropriate user contexts. These files are usually in:
        ~/.ssh/ChangeByUs/*.pem or ~/.ssh/ChangeByUs/id_rsa
      The "key_filename" option in the RCFile defines the file to use, and can
      be changed based on the user environment.
      However, it is recommended that all deployment administrators use a
      standardized structure for storage of these files so as to limit
      confusion or inconsistency.
    * A source tree in a standardized location. The git source tree is expected
      to be at ~/Projects/LP/<project-name>:
        ~/Projects/LP/lp-changebyus
      This path is defined by the "local_path" option in the RCFile.
      
      [TODO: this really should not be required since the deployer should
      have a way of pulling the code to a working location and creating the
      final configurations from it. However this functionality is not yet
      implemented.]
    * The necessary RCfiles in a separate location. Eg.:
      ~/Projects/LP/configs/lp-changebyus/rcfile.*

To change the paths, do the following:
    * Ensure that the local_path option in the rcfile is correct
    * Clone the project into the appropriate folder

Once the system is set up, the deployment steps are:
  fab -f /path/to/fabfile.py \
      --config=/path/to/rcfile.XX ENV \
      <list of tasks>
      
where:
  /path/to/ : the path to the fabfile.py or rcfile.env. NOTE that fabric
              does NOT handle ~ (user-path) correctly, so always specify
              full path. Relative paths from current location work fine
  rcfile.XX : The rcfile to use. Ensure that you provide the /path/to/
              correctly. If you receive an error such as:
                  "AttributeError: local_path"
              this is indication that your rcfile was not read correctly.
              Check your paths!
  ENV       : The environment that the configuration is specific to. This
              is actually a task which processes all the system and
              required variables, and is usually one of live, prod, demo, dev.

Deployment TASKS (Overview):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tasks for deployment are generally found at the top of the fabfile.py file,
in the CookBook section. To get detailed information about the function of each
available task, run:
  fab --list

Some of the more common sets of tasks are below.
* Setting up an initial system with all pre-requisites.
  NOTE: This task should NOT be necessary on an already functional host
    fab --config=/path/to/rcfile.demo demo \
        setup_system

* Setup servers (either web or application)
      fab --config=rcfile.dev dev setup_application

* Standard deployment of branch defined in rcfile, with webserver restart:
    fab --config=/path/to/rcfile.demo demo \
        bundle_code deploy_webapp_and_configs 

* Only deploy configuration updates, but not new code
    fab --config=/path/to/rcfile.demo demo \
        deploy_configurations

* Deploy the latest code, change the 'current' symlink, but don't restart
  webserver. This is useful if you want to just put code up, but don't want
  the webserver to know about it yet.
    fab --config=/path/to/rcfile.demo demo \
        bundle_code deploy_app_and_configs

    You can then run the
    fab --config=/path/to/rcfile.demo demo \
        restart_webserver
    task to ... um ... restart the webserver.

* Deploy the latest code, but don't symlink, and don't do anything else:
    fab --config=/path/to/rcfile.demo demo \
        bundle_code upload_and_explode_code_bundle

* Rollback the deploment (NOT YET TESTED):
    fab --config=/path/to/rcfile.demo demo \
        rollback
          
    This will:
        mv current next
        mv previous current

MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The fabfile.py does not yet support the following features:
    * Automatically installing updated requirements.txt. This is WIP
    * Running database migrations. This must be done manually

The fabric script DOES perform CSS and JS minification just prior to 
deployment via the minifier.py script (after first doing a submodule update)


QUICK START STEPS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The credentials.tgz is a tarball provided by Local Projects. The archive contains
configuration files (rcfiles) and private keys all in GPG encrypted format. The recipients
are currently gdamiani@911memorial.org and sundar@localprojects.net.
Other recipients must request access from one of these contacts.

    # Install Python packages:
    pip install fabric
    
    # Create the project structure
    mkdir -p ~/Projects
    cd ~/Projects

    # Set up the credentials stuff, once you receive a credentials package from LP
    mkdir -p ~/Projects/configs
    mv /path/to/credentials.tgz.gpg ~/Projects/configs/
    cd ~/Projects/configs
    gpg -d credentials.tgz.gpg > credentials.tgz && tar -xzf credentials.tgz
    
    # Get the code and deploy to central servers
    # Note that the --config option to fabric MUST be a full path, and not 
    # relative paths
    git clone git@git.assembla.com:lp-changebyus.git
    
    # Start a deployment to the central servers
    cd lp-changebyus
    fab -f script/fabfile.py --config=$HOME/Projects/configs/credentials/rcfile.cfa prod \
        bundle_code deploy_webapp_and_configs

MISCELLANEOUS TROUBLESHOOTING AND SYSTEM SETUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

UTF-8 ENCODING AND PYTHON
-----------------------------
When running the python scripts you may get:
    Got incorrect data and error: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe9' 
    in position 483: ordinal not in range(128)
or something similar. The reason is that Python uses ASCII encoding by default. 
It's worthwhile to change python's default encoding to utf-8 to avoid this issue.
The way to do this is:
    if [ ! -e /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sitecustomize.py ];then
        touch /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sitecustomize.py
        echo -n "import sys\nsys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')" >> /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sitecustomize.py
    fi
